# T9 Keyboard for TESLA meshtastic
> This is an experimental, low-polish project and without docs.  
It’s shared for reference and tinkering, not as a ready-to-build design.  
Proceed only if you’re comfortable filling in the gaps yourself.  

It's a sub part for an undocumented project that I'm calling TESLA meshtastic.  
Its main purpuse is to find out if a T9 style (4x3) keyboard can be used as a text input for meshtastic.
